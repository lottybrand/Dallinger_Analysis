“full_data” consists of the “info table” from the Dallinger database. 
The info table is a record of every “info” that was submitted by every “node” in the experiment. 
One node in each group is the “source node” which sends the questions to the rest of the nodes. 
Every other node is a player. 
An info can be a question, an answer to a question, a choice to ask someone else, the choice of who to copy, and the content that was copied. 
for the full_data we have removed all of the source’s infos and concentrated only on the player’s infos for each group. 

full_data variables:
(taken from original database):

number:  	the question number that the participants are answering at this time. Should be 		between 1-100

copying:  whether this info was copying instance or not. should be true or false. Note that 
		      ‘ask someone else’ is not marked as a copying instance, because that is an asocial choice to copy. 
		      Once they have chosen someone to copy, that info is marked as ‘true’, as is the content of the player’s answer that           they copied. 

score:	  whether that particular answer was correct or not. only the contents of a copied answer is marked correct if it was           correct, not the chosen player’s node or the		initial choice to copy.

info_chosen:  	In round 2, this is which info_choice they chose when choosing to ask someone else. Should be either “Player                  ID”, “Times Chosen in Round 1” or “Total Score in 			Round 1”, Note that these are marked as NA in round 1,                 unless it is a copying instance, in which the info choice is the default info for that condition. 

round: 	which round the players are in. Should be 1 or 2. 

human:  	tells us if the participant submitted the answer themselves or if it was automatically generated by the timer timing           -out and forcing the wrong answer. says “true” if the 		button was pressed, says “false” if the timer timed out. 

id:		This is the info ID (not player ID!). It is unique to each database (i.e. run of the experiment. so will carry on into        different networks if multiple are run at once). 

Contents: 	The content of the info, e.g. what answer was submitted, whether they “asked someone else”, who they chose to copy             , what the copied info consisted of. 

Origin: 	This is effectively the participant ID, it is the origin node ID of that particular info. Needs to be re-indexed to           be unique across all runs, not just within a run. 

Network: 	Network id is effectively group ID. Multiple networks (groups of 10 players) will be run at once. 

(variables I computed myself): 

Condition: Recorded in property2 of the node table. This is entered manually in data_inputting, as we ran the conditions sequentially.

u_origin: 	Origin ID re-indexed to be unique across every network and condition. 

u_network: network ID r-indexed to be unique across every run

u_id: info id reindexed to be unique across networks and conditions

c_a_score_r1: cumulative ASOCIAL score in Round 1

t_score: total score including copies

t_copied: total times ppt chose to copy, across both rounds

c_copies: times participant was copied themself, in round 1

copied_successful: binary 1, 0 did they copy the highest scoring demonstrator of those available (not including when it was a tie, or if there was only one demonstrator to choose from)

copied_prestigious: binary 1, 0 did they copy the most copied demonstrator of those available (not including when it was a tie, or if there was only one demonstrator to choose from)

is_model_id: the experiment infos records two infos per copy: their choice to copy, and the model id of the person they chose to copy. This is a way of filtering only the information of who was chosen to copy.
